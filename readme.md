#Goomblog ("Dream" Blog)

# The RESTful Routes
1) Index - Shows all journal/blog entries (in the description, should show either KEY EVENTS that occurred if the user lists them, or simply a short portion of the entry)
2) New - Page with forms to create a new journal/blog entry
3) Create - Creates the new journal entry and redirects the user somewhere
4) Show - Shows detail about one specific journal entry
5) Edit - Shows a page with forms (that are already filled out) so the user can edit the entry
6) Update - Updates the entry with the given info and redirects the user somewhere
7) Destroy - Allows the user to delete/remove an item and redirects the user somewhere

# Additional Features:
1) Send an old fashioned letter to a friend, with a post-card type or letter-type message?
2) Provide the option to play a (rather large) play list of classical / soothing music?
